This study explores the intricacies of implied volatility forecasting, with a specific focus on analyzing the methodologies presented in ‘A Neural Network Approach to Understanding Implied Volatility Move- ments’ by Jay Cao, Jacky Chen, and John C. Hull (Quantitative Finance, 20, 2020). Our approach involves a thorough examination and replication of their procedures, followed by the identification of po- tential pitfalls and areas for improvement. We pay special attention to their methods of feature and target engineering, along with the complexities of model training. We investigate the possibility of unintentional errors in data preprocessing and model training leading to misleading outcomes, where high-complexity models may appear superior to basic linear models. Subsequently, we propose refined methods for volatil- ity forecasting, including new metrics and data segmentation methods, to ensure the derivation of valid and robust results. This study aims to contribute to the advancement of reliable and effective volatil- ity forecasting methodologies while fostering a deeper understanding of the associated challenges and opportunities.
